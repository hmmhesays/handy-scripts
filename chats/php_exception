Data Passed to set_exception_handler()
The function registered with set_exception_handler() will receive an instance of an exception, specifically an object of a class that extends Throwable (either Exception or Error).

For example:

php
Copy
Edit
set_exception_handler(function (Throwable $e) {
    echo "Uncaught Exception: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    echo "File: " . $e->getFile() . "\n";
    echo "Line: " . $e->getLine() . "\n";
    echo "Stack trace:\n" . $e->getTraceAsString();
});

throw new Exception("Something went wrong!");
Available Exception Data
The exception object (Throwable $e) provides the following methods to access data:

$e->getMessage() – The error message.
$e->getCode() – The error code (if any).
$e->getFile() – The file where the exception was thrown.
$e->getLine() – The line number where the exception was thrown.
$e->getTrace() – An array representing the call stack.
$e->getTraceAsString() – A string representation of the call stack.
$e->getPrevious() – If the exception was chained, this returns the previous exception.
Would you like a specific example or customization for logging?








You said:
I would like to be able to know what exception was thrown. I would like to also call a custom handler function within that exception if one is set in that class. Is this possible?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, it's possible! You can determine the exact exception class and check if it defines a custom handler method. If it does, you can invoke that method dynamically.

Steps:
Use get_class($e) to determine the exception class.
Check if the exception object has a custom method using method_exists($e, 'customHandler').
Call the method dynamically if it exists.
Example:
php
Copy
Edit
set_exception_handler(function (Throwable $e) {
    echo "Uncaught Exception of type: " . get_class($e) . "\n";
    echo "Message: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    echo "File: " . $e->getFile() . "\n";
    echo "Line: " . $e->getLine() . "\n";

    // Check if the exception has a custom handler
    if (method_exists($e, 'customHandler')) {
        echo "Calling custom handler...\n";
        $e->customHandler();
    } else {
        echo "No custom handler defined.\n";
    }
});

// Custom Exception with a handler method
class MyException extends Exception {
    public function customHandler() {
        echo "Handling MyException specifically!\n";
    }
}

// Throwing the custom exception
throw new MyException("Something went wrong!");
Output:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Uncaught Exception of type: MyException
Message: Something went wrong!
File: /path/to/script.php
Line: 28
Calling custom handler...
Handling MyException specifically!
This way, you can detect the specific exception type and call its custom method dynamically. Would you like further refinements, such as logging or different handling per class?







You said:
Where do the code and the message come from. Is that set when I throw the exception?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, the code and message of an exception are set when you throw it, either explicitly or by default.

Where Do They Come From?
Message: This is the first argument when you create an exception. If not provided, it defaults to an empty string ("").
Code: This is the second argument, which defaults to 0 if not specified.
Example:
php
Copy
Edit
throw new Exception("Something went wrong!", 1001);
Here:

Message = "Something went wrong!"
Code = 1001
Exception Constructor
The Exception class constructor looks like this:

php
Copy
Edit
public function __construct(
    string $message = "", 
    int $code = 0, 
    ?Throwable $previous = null
)
$message → The exception message.
$code → The exception code.
$previous → A previous exception (for chaining).
Retrieving the Values
Once caught (or passed to set_exception_handler), you can retrieve these values:

php
Copy
Edit
set_exception_handler(function (Throwable $e) {
    echo "Exception Message: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    echo "Exception Code: " . $e->getCode() . "\n";
});

throw new Exception("Custom error message", 42);
Output:
php
Copy
Edit
Exception Message: Custom error message
Exception Code: 42
Would you like to enforce specific exception codes or create a base exception class to standardize them?
