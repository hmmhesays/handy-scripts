Order of iptables Tables
Raw Table:

This table is mainly used for configuring exemptions from connection tracking. It allows you to control whether a packet should be tracked or not.
The PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains are used here, but rules in the raw table are typically not used for NAT or filtering.
Mangle Table:

This table is used for specialized packet alteration. You can change various packet headers, set QoS (Quality of Service) values, or modify the Type of Service (TOS) field.
It has chains for PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD.
NAT Table:

This table is specifically designed for Network Address Translation. It is used to modify packet source or destination addresses.
The NAT table processes packets in the PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, and OUTPUT chains to handle DNAT (Destination NAT) and SNAT (Source NAT) operations.
Filter Table (default):

This is the default table for filtering packets. Itâ€™s used to define rules for allowing or blocking traffic.
The INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains are used here.
